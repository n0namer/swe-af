	"## How Git Worktrees Work\n" +
	"\n" +
	"A git worktree is a separate working directory linked to the same repository.\n" +
	"Each worktree has its own branch and index, so commits in one worktree don't\n" +
	"affect others. This is the key isolation mechanism for parallel coding agents.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Your Responsibilities\n" +
	"\n" +
	"For each issue in this level, create a worktree using the **exact command format specified in the task**.\n" +
	"The task will provide either a plain format or a Build-ID-prefixed format — always follow the task.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Default (no Build ID):\n" +
	"```bash\n" +
	"git worktree add <worktrees_dir>/issue-<NN>-<name> -b issue/<NN>-<name> <integration_branch>\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"With Build ID (when the task specifies one — CRITICAL: you MUST use this form):\n" +
	"```bash\n" +
	"git worktree add <worktrees_dir>/issue-<BUILD_ID>-<NN>-<name> -b issue/<BUILD_ID>-<NN>-<name> <integration_branch>\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"This creates:\n" +
	"- A new directory at the worktrees path\n" +
	"- A new branch starting from the integration branch\n" +
	"- An isolated working copy where the coder agent can freely edit files\n" +

	"## Constraints\n" +
	"\n" +
	"- If a branch with the target name already exists, remove the old worktree first and recreate.\n" +

	"## Ownership and Safety Gate\n" +
	"\n" +
	"For each requested branch/worktree, do ALL of the following in order:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"1. Verify the branch is owned by the current build: its name must start with\n" +

	"2. Verify the worktree is clean with\n" +
	"   `git -C <worktree_path> status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`.\n" +
	"   If any output is present, DO NOT remove it.\n" +
	"3. Remove a clean owned worktree with `git worktree remove <worktree_path>` —\n" +
	"   never use `--force`.\n" +
	"4. Delete the owned branch with `git branch -d <branch>`. If Git refuses\n" +
	"   because the branch is unmerged, preserve it and report failure.\n" +
	"5. After safe removals, run `git worktree prune`.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Critical: Error Handling\n" +
	"\n" +
	"- If an entry is dirty, unowned, unmerged, or cannot be verified, preserve it.\n" +
	"- Never use `rm -rf`, `git worktree remove --force`, or `git branch -D`.\n" +
	"- Continue checking the remaining requested entries, but report `success=false`\n" +
	"  if any requested entry could not be safely cleaned.\n" +

	"\n" +
	"1. Record the current branch as `original_branch`.\n" +
	"2. Ensure the working tree is clean (warn if not, but proceed).\n" +
	"3. Create an integration branch from HEAD:\n" +
	"   - If a **Build ID** is provided in the task: `git checkout -b feature/<build-id>-<goal-slug>`\n" +
	"   - Otherwise: `git checkout -b feature/<goal-slug>`\n" +
	"4. Record the initial commit SHA (HEAD before any work).\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Worktrees Directory\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Create `<repo_path>/.worktrees/` — this is where parallel worktrees will be\n" +
	"placed. Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` if not already there.\n" +

	"\n" +
	"Set the project up for clean development from the start:\n" +

	"- Create or update `.gitignore` based on the project's language and ecosystem.\n" +
	"  Detect the language from existing files (package.json → Node.js, pyproject.toml\n" +
	"  → Python, Cargo.toml → Rust, go.mod → Go, etc.) and include the standard\n" +
	"  ignore patterns that every developer in that ecosystem expects.\n" +
	"- Always include patterns for: pipeline artifacts (`.artifacts/`), worktrees\n" +
	"  (`.worktrees/`), environment files (`.env`), and OS files (`.DS_Store`).\n" +
	"- A well-maintained `.gitignore` prevents entire categories of problems\n" +
	"  downstream — treat it as infrastructure, not an afterthought.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Remote Detection\n" +
	"\n" +
	"After setting up the branch, check for a remote origin:\n" +
	"- Run `git remote get-url origin` — if it succeeds, record the URL as `remote_url`.\n" +
	"- Run `git remote show origin` or inspect `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` to determine\n" +
	"  the default branch (e.g. \"main\"). Record it as `remote_default_branch`.\n" +

	"resolve any conflicts intelligently.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Merge Strategy\n" +
	"\n" +
	"1. **Sequential `--no-ff` merges**: Merge one branch at a time using\n" +
	"   `git merge <branch> --no-ff -m \"Merge <branch>: <title>\"`.\n" +
	"2. **Order by dependency**: If branches have known dependencies, merge the\n" +
	"   upstream branch first.\n" +
	"3. **One at a time**: Never merge multiple branches simultaneously. This lets\n" +
	"   you catch and resolve conflicts incrementally.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Conflict Resolution\n" +
	"\n" +
	"When a merge conflict occurs:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"1. **Understand intent**: Read the conflicting changes from BOTH branches.\n" +
	"   Understand what each branch was trying to accomplish.\n" +
	"2. **Read context**: Check the issue descriptions and architecture to understand\n" +
	"   the desired behavior.\n" +
	"3. **Resolve semantically**: Don't just pick one side. Combine non-overlapping\n" +
	"   logic. For same-line conflicts, the later-dependency branch takes priority\n" +
	"   (it depends on earlier work).\n" +
	"4. **Stage and commit**: After resolving, `git add <files>` and\n" +
	"   `git commit -m \"Resolve conflict: <description>\"`.\n" +
	"5. **Record resolution**: Track each conflict resolution in the output for\n" +
	"   the integration tester to verify.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Sanity Checking\n" +
	"\n" +
	"After EACH individual merge:\n" +
	"- Check for syntax errors: `python3 -c \"import ast; ast.parse(open('<file>').read())\"` for Python\n" +
	"- Check for broken imports if applicable\n" +
	"- If a sanity check fails, attempt to fix the issue before proceeding\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Integration Test Decision\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Set `needs_integration_test = true` if ANY of these apply:\n" +
	"- Conflicts were resolved (even simple ones)\n" +
	"- Multiple branches modified the same files\n" +
	"- Branches implement features that interact (e.g., one provides an API another consumes)\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Set `needs_integration_test = false` only if:\n" +
	"- All merges were clean (no conflicts)\n" +
	"- Branches are fully independent (different files, no interaction)\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Repo Quality Gate\n" +
	"\n" +
	"After completing all merges, step back and assess the repository as a whole:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"- Does the working tree look like something you'd hand off to another\n" +
	"  engineer? Or does it have leftover scaffolding, broken symlinks,\n" +
	"  generated artifacts, or empty placeholder files that served their\n" +
	"  purpose during development but shouldn't ship?\n" +
	"- Check `git status` — are there untracked files that indicate a coder\n" +
	"  agent left behind development artifacts (dependency dirs, build outputs,\n" +
	"  tool caches)?\n" +
	"- If `.gitignore` is missing or incomplete for the project's ecosystem,\n" +
	"  note it in the summary. The repo should be self-defending against\n" +
	"  accidental artifact commits.\n" +
	"- Clean up anything that a senior engineer would flag in a PR review:\n" +
	"  remove broken symlinks, empty `.gitkeep` files in directories that now\n" +
	"  have content, and any other development detritus.\n" +
	"- Commit cleanup separately: `\"chore: clean up repo after merge\"`\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Output\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Return a MergeResult JSON object with:\n" +

	"- Report counters consistently: `tests_run` must equal `tests_passed + tests_failed`.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Testing Strategy\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### Priority 1: Conflict Resolution Areas\n" +
	"If conflicts were resolved during the merge, write tests that specifically\n" +
	"exercise the resolved code paths. These are the highest-risk areas.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### Priority 2: Cross-Feature Interactions\n" +
	"If feature A provides an API that feature B consumes, write tests verifying\n" +

	"\n" +
	"## Test Writing Guidelines\n" +
	"\n" +
	"- Write tests in the project's existing test framework if one exists.\n" +
	"- If no test framework exists, create a proper test file using the   language's standard test library (pytest for Python, cargo test for Rust,   jest/vitest for JS/TS).\n" +
	"- Keep tests focused and fast — test interactions, not individual features.\n" +
	"- Name test files descriptively based on WHAT they test:\n" +
	"  - Good: `test_parser_lexer_integration.py`, `test_api_auth_flow.py`\n" +
	"  - Bad: `test_integration_1.py`, `test_level_2.py`, `test_basic.py`\n" +

	"2. **Delete only allowlisted generated/untracked artifacts** — examples: untracked cache/build/dependency directories created by tools (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `.artifacts/`, `.worktrees/`, ecosystem build caches). A path being unfamiliar is NOT evidence that it is disposable.\n" +
	"3. **Preserve tracked and user-owned files** — never delete a path reported by `git ls-files`, and never delete untracked content unless its generated-artifact ownership is clear from a standard tool convention or pipeline-owned directory. If uncertain, leave it and report it.\n" +
	"4. **Fortify the .gitignore** — add only standard/generated patterns that match observed tooling; never use `.gitignore` to hide an unexplained or required file.\n" +
